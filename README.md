# frhttp-socket-io-sample
A simple chat client showing how to hook FRHTTP up to socket.io

This simple project demonstrates using FRHTTP with socket.io.  It's a remake of the socket.io chat app, but using FRHTTP.
It also adds the ability to push to the chat client from a normal HTTP/GET to demonstrate running different paths
through the same route in FRHTTP.
